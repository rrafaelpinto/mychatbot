I earned my Ph.D. in Health Sciences from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil, in 2019, and I completed a postdoctoral study (2022) from the Health Sciences Research Unit (UICISA-E) in Portugal. During my postdoctoral studies, I conducted comparative analyses of clinical protocols and therapeutic guidelines used in both countries (Brazil and Portugal) in managing syphilis in pregnant women and congenital cases. I also aimed to comparatively examine health systems with a platform developed by the Laboratory of Technological Innovation in Health (LAIS), used to control and manage syphilis cases in Brazil. One of the significant results of my postdoctoral studies is identifying differences and similarities in clinical protocols and therapeutic guidelines used in Brazil and Portugal. This finding could help improve the management of syphilis in pregnant women and congenital cases in both countries. My doctoral research involved the characterization and extraction of a molecule (carbohydrate) from the ear of corn. With this carbohydrate, we synthesized a nanoparticle containing silver, and from this nanoformulation, we conducted tests for assessing the trypanocidal activity of silver nanoparticles with xylan polysaccharide against different evolutionary forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. I also had the opportunity to teach Pharmacology classes at the Faculty of Science and Technology, a Nursing course, and in a Biomedicine course at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. In addition, I was approved in a vetting process for a substitute professor position at the UFRN.
